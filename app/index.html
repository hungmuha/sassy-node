        <h4>What is Cards Against Assembly?</h4>
        <p>
          Cards Against Assembly is a party game for General Assembly Students. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Assembly is as amazing and wonderful as you and your friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.
