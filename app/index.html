              <h4>What is Cards Against Assembly?</h4>
              <p>
                Cards Against Assembly is a party game for General Assembly Students. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Assembly is as amazing and wonderful as you and your friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.
